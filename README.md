# Mocha
A auto-clicker that's currently being worked on by me. The project was started around the end of August 2023, and the first version was worked on and completed within 3 hours.

# Features:
- Easy-to-use, Mouse click to mark the autoclicker start
- Cursor Location and Time Interval Precision
- Looping Functionality (Allows you to set a loop and set intervals between loops)
- Delay before Auto-clicker start
- Compatible with multiple monitors

# How to use
- Type in the number of auto-clicks
- Click on any section of the screen that you want mouse to click
- Confirm other settings
- Review Settings and Execute
- Press Esc button to stop the autoclicker

NOTE: Program will close when there is a syntax error, currently being fixed

# In Development
- Further Customisation Settings (E.g. Being able to adjust the interval timings between 2 clicks)
- Pause and Resume Function 
- Conversion of the program into C#
- Keyboard auto-clicker
- Graphic User Interface
